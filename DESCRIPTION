Description:
  Public reporting of continuously updated health care quality is to be
  established based on data from all hospitals in Norway. Indicators of quality
  will be provided along a user defined hierarchy of geographical and
  organizational dimensions through a web interface. Here, we propose a
  solution by combining technology such as R, Shiny, docker, continuous
  integration and delivery.
